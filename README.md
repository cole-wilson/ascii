ASCII Facetime/Zoom is a proof-of-concept project I made to transmit camera images over TCP sockets and display it in color in the terminal. It was my Hacker Zephyr hackathon project and was supposed to be like an "offline" version of the always-present Zoom or Facetime. The end goal was to create a fully functional terminal app with sound and other features.
